1) Chess piece
   1)
      1.1) 6 white and 6 black chess pieces with separate UV cards and 1k textures.
      1.2) 6 white and 6 black chess pieces with a common UV card and 2k texture.
   2)
      18 animations for each figure (idle, attack, movement, death, etc.)
     
   + pixel textures, prefabs

  Rig: 12 bones per figure, except for "Horse" (17 bones)

  Polygon: Each figure does not exceed 1ê of triangles
  All 32 pieces like (in standard chess) have 26k triangles

2) Environment
   1) Combined

      1.1) Combined battlefield for chess with one UV map and one 4k texture + movable elements (doors, ropes, flags)
      1.2) Combined battlefield for chess from three parts with three UV maps and three 2k textures + movable elements
      
   2) Separate elements (for creating prefabs)

      1.1) Separate elements from which the battlefield for chess is created (bricks, walls, boards, etc.) with one UV map and one 4k texture
      1.2) Separate elements from which the battlefield for chess is created (bricks, walls, boards, etc.) with separate UV maps and separate 1k textures
    
   3) Additional individual elements: grass,sky,clouds,puddles.

   + pixel textures, prefabs 

   Polygon: Combined scene using baking light - 18k triangles
   Combined scene with chess pieces using baking light - 44k triangles

Three demo scenes

ATTENTION! To display some elements (raincoats, flags, grass), you need a two-sided shader

   I used the free Double Sided Shaders by CICONIA STUDIO.

Also for render previews of scenes I used the following free assets:

   - Post Processing Stack by UNITY TECHNOLOGIES

   - Unity Particle Pack by UNITY TECHNOLOGIES

   - Water Effect Fits For Lowpoly Style by PURE EVIL STUDIO
